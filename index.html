    <h2><I><p>Who/What is ChatGPT?</p></I></h2>
    <p> <font style="font-size: large;">ChatGPT is a computer program developed by OpenAI. It's designed to assist with answering questions, providing information, and engaging in text-based conversations on a wide range of topics.</font></p>
    <br>
    <p> <font style="font-size: larger;"><strong>Let's get into more description:</strong></font>  </p>
    <p><font style="font-size: large;"> ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) language model developed by OpenAI. It is part of the GPT <sup>3.5</sup> architecture, which stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5." ChatGPT is specifically designed for natural language understanding and generation, making it capable of engaging in text-based conversations with users. 
    <br> <br>
        Here's how ChatGPT works:
        <br>
        1. Pre-training: ChatGPT is trained on a massive amount of text data from the internet. This pre-training phase helps the model learn grammar, facts, and some reasoning abilities by predicting the next word in a sentence. It becomes familiar with the structure of language and the patterns in text.
        <br>
        2. Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the model undergoes a fine-tuning process using specific datasets created by OpenAI. During this phase, the model is trained on custom datasets that include demonstrations of correct behavior and ranking of different responses. Fine-tuning helps narrow down the model's behavior to make it more useful and safe for user interactions.
        <br>
        3. Natural Language Understanding: ChatGPT uses its pre-trained knowledge to understand user inputs. It can recognize the intent behind questions and statements, identify entities (like names, dates, or places), and comprehend context within a conversation.
        <br>
        4. Text Generation: Once ChatGPT understands the user's input, it generates text-based responses. It generates responses based on patterns it has learned during pre-training and fine-tuning. It tries to provide coherent and contextually relevant answers to user queries.
        <br>
        5. Context Management: ChatGPT maintains context during conversations. It remembers previous messages in a conversation and uses that context to provide more relevant responses. This helps in having multi-turn conversations with the model.
        <br>
        6. Human Feedback: OpenAI has used human feedback to train ChatGPT and make it better over time. This feedback loop helps improve the model's responses, reduce biases, and enhance its overall performance.
        <br>
        It's important to note that while ChatGPT is a powerful language model, it may not always provide accurate or perfect answers, and it might generate responses that seem plausible but are incorrect or nonsensical. Users should exercise critical thinking and verify information obtained from AI models like ChatGPT, especially for important or sensitive topics.
        <br>
        OpenAI continues to refine and improve its models, and newer versions may have different capabilities and characteristics compared to the information I provide, which is accurate as of my last training data in September <sub>2021</sub>.
